# Stardew Valley Archipelago - Farm Type

## Farm Type

The Farm Type setting allows you to choose which [farm](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Maps) you will be playing on for this playthrough. It is the only setting that defaults to `random`, and it is recommended to keep it as such, as it fits the randomizer better, thematically.

The Farm Type must be chosen from the yaml file because the generator needs to be aware of which farm you will have, as it makes certain items in logic earlier. It can even enable/disable some location checks.

### You cannot use custom modded farms with Archipelago.

The [farm types](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Maps) are:
- Standard - Lots of farming land, no special features
- Riverland - Very little land, lots of water. Can catch freshwater fish on the farm. The player starts with a single fish smoker.
- Forest - Medium amount of land, forageables spawn on the farm. There are some hardwood stumps that respawn every day.
- Hill-top - Medium amount of land, there is a quarry on the farm that spawns ores.
- Wilderness - Medium amount of land, monsters spawn at night.
- Four Corners - Lots of farming land, one respawning stump, and a mini-quarry. This farm is split into four distinct areas.
- Beach - Lots of farming land, but most of it cannot support sprinklers. Forest and beach forageables can spawn, and supply crates wash up on the shore. This farm contains one secret.
- Meadowlands - Medium amount of land, the player starts with a coop and two chickens. In Archipelago, your first coop is automatically unlocked. Has blue grass, and starting seeds are replaced with Hay.
