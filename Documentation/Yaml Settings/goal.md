# Stardew Valley Archipelago Goals

## Goal

The goal you choose is your completion condition for your slot. If playing alone, it does not matter much, as you can play and stop whenever you feel like it.

But when playing in a multiworld, you are generally making a commitment to "win" the multiworld, which means everyone reaches their goal.

In many cases, some server settings are related to the goal. For example, many multiworlds automatically release all remaining locations in a slot when that slot reaches its goal.

Fulfill the goal = Win!

In-game, you can read Grandpa's letter on his shrine to get reminded of what your goal is for this playthrough. The letter can only be read once.

## Goal Traits

- *Short*: This goal is very short. Can be used in sync games. Can be disappointing if you expect something similar to the vanilla game.
- *Long*: This goal is very long. It will probably take a few tens of hours, and should only be used in async games that are expected to take a while. You should only play this goal if you are very experienced in both the vanilla game and the randomizer.
- *Adaptable*: This goal's exact victory conditions will adapt to one or multiple other settings in your slot.
- *Focused*: This goal focuses on a single game mechanic, and excluding the potential for randomized items to be found elsewhere (depending on what you randomized), you will not be required to explore multiple game mechanics to finish the slot. *Focused* goals are generally less interesting, so are often used in themed games or challenge runs.
- *Coopable*: This goal relies on server status, and therefore several players can progress the same slot together to complete it.

## Goals

### Community Center

#### This is the main goal of Stardew Valley Archipelago. The randomizer is balanced around this goal, and it is the recommended goal for most players.

Restore the community center, by completing every bundle in every room. External bundles, like for example the missing bundle or the raccoon requests still exist in the world, but are not considered part of the goal.

- This goal can be **Short** and it can be **Long**. This will be mostly decided by the setting ~~[Bundle Price](./bundle_price.md)~~
- This goal is partially *Adaptable*. Settings like ~~[Bundle Randomization](./bundle_randomization.md)~~ and ~~[Bundle Price](./bundle_price.md)~~ will change the content of the bundles and therefore have a significant impact on the goal. Settings like ~~[Exclude Ginger Island](./exclude_ginger_island.md)~~ will have a slight impact, by allowing or banning certain items from appearing in bundles.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. You will be doing a bit of everything to fulfill bundles.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. To win, a save file must exist with a fully locally completed Community Center

### Grandpa's Evaluation

#### Obtain 4 candles during [Grandpa's Evaluation](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grandpa).

In Archipelago, you do not need to wait for year 2 to get evaluated. Grandpa evaluates you every single morning, so your slot will goal as soon as it qualifies.
The mod provides a built-in tracker for evaluation points, shown above Grandpa's Shrine.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. There are many things to do to obtain grandpa points and you can decide which ones to work on.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single farm must have a score sufficient to win the goal.

### Bottom of the Mines

#### Reach Floor 120 in the Pelican Town Mines

It is recommended to shuffle elevators, tools and skill levels to synergize with this goal.

- This goal is *Short*. It can be finished in a very reasonable time, and a skilled player can progress much beyond logic itself and goal even earlier.
- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal, although randomizing elevators is an extremely important decision.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly mining and combat.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single player must reach Floor 120 only once.

### Cryptic Note

#### Complete the Quest 'Cryptic Note', which requires reaching Floor 100 of the Skull Cavern.

This goal requires to find the `Magnifying Glass`, the `Skull Key`, and some way to access `The Desert`. Then you must find the correct secret note, and lastly you must perform a deep Skull Cavern Dive. This requires a certain level of proficiency from the player, as an inexperienced player might be unable to complete the quest no matter how much stuff they unlock.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal. Using the mod [Skull Cavern Elevator](../Supported Mods.md) can trivialize this goal.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly mining and combat.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single player must complete the quest.

### Master Angler

#### Catch Every Fish

You must catch every fish available in the world. It is recommended to use Fishsanity with this goal, so that catching individual fish provides rewards, instead of being all pointless until the very last one.

- This goal is *Adaptable*. If ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~ is enabled, the Goal becomes to catch every fish that has been chosen as a Fishsanity location, for example catching all easy fish.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly fishing.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~ is enabled, the goal is to send every Fishsanity location, not to actually catch the fish. Several players can coop a slot to send each a subset of the fish. If Fishsanity is diabled, the goal reverts to the vanilla definition which is **not** *Coopable*.
