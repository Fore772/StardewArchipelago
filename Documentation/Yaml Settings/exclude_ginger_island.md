# Stardew Valley Archipelago - Exclude Ginger Island

## Exclude Ginger Island

Exclude Ginger Island is a toggle setting. You set it to either true, or false.

This setting is a wide-reaching modifier for your entire slot. If enabled, it will disable all Ginger Island related content, from every other setting, and the game itself.

Notably, this means that you will **not** be provided with unlocks that allow you to reach the island at all. No Boat Repair, no Island Obelisk, no Island Warp Totems, and no recipes to craft them.

The island still exists in the game itself, of course, so you might be able to reach it using cheats or bugs. But that is not intended. Your entire progression path will be intended to happen without it.

### Things that this setting disables

- All Bundles that are themed after Ginger Island content (ex: Island Foraging Bundle)
- All Bundle items that require Ginger Island will be excluded from their bundles (ex: Pina Colada will not appear in the Bartender Bundle, but the bundle itself can still appear)
- The 3 island fish, plus the 5 extended family legendary fish
- The 2 island saplings and 2 crops
- All of the island and volcano monsters. Monster Eradication goals that are exclusively island monsters are removed, but goals that contain some island monsters and some mainland monsters will remain.
- Leo
- The island quests
- Every parrot task and walnut related behavior
- The island-exclusive journal scraps and bone artifacts
- All of the Qi Special Orders and their direct and indirect rewards (Qi beans, radioactive ore, etc)
- Everything being sold at the Qi Gem shop, Island trader, and volcano dwarf (recipes, books, etc)
- The 2 island-related special orders
- The boat repairing tasks
- Ostriches
- The 4 forageables only obtainable on the island
- The 5 Cooking recipes and 12 crafting recipes that are either learned on the island, or crafted using island materials
- All modded content that is either on the island, or after it.

### Things that this setting overrides

- Qi Orders. If you enabled them, they will be forcefully disabled if you Exclude Ginger Island

### Things that override this setting

- Perfection and Walnut Hunter goals. These two goals have very strict requirements on the Island, and if they are chosen, Exclude Ginger Island will be forced to `false`, so that the goals are completable.

## The Future

It is possible that, in the future, some settings appear that perform a similar role to this one, for other large sections of the game.
Notably, here are some ideas that have been discussed, but not implemented.

- Arcade Machine only mode (Exclude everything else)
- Exclude The Desert
- Ginger Island only mode (Exclude mainland content)
